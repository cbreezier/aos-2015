M3:
    Address Space:
        - Linked list of sorted regions
        - Special pointers to stack and heap

        - 10x10x12 page table, such that we can store
        each level in exactly one page.
            - Only the svaddr is stored per entry.

        - pt_caps and pt_addrs also stored in exactly one page each.
        These are used to delete kernel pt caps and ut_free, respectively.

    - Each page is mapped twice - once for SOS and once for the user process.
        - This allows copyin/copyout to be much easier.
        - Caps for both of these mappings are stored inside the frame table.

    - The page directory and page tables are stored in frames provided by the frametable.
